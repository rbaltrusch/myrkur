# Myrkur

Myrkur, my game jam entry for the 48h Kenney jam 2023, written in Lua with the Love library.

## How to run

To run, download lua and the love framework, then run love.exe in the current folder:

```
love .
```

Note: you may have to specify the full path to the love executable if it is not on your path.
